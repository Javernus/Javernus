I am Jake. I am an avid programmer—lover of types—and much more. Playing piano, photography, writing (and reading) and gaming are some of my other hobbies.

I am a developer with 4+ years of experience in front-end, being one of the developers and the Product Owner of the design system made at Enreach for their products. 
I am currently working on my Bachelor Thesis focussed on Quantum Computing and will be continuing with the Quantum Computer Science Master afterwards. 
In my free time, I write a lot. Be it code or a story, I know my way around a pen. I like learning about many things, and philosophise a lot, too—sometimes even in the realm of a world I am building for a book.

I am passionate in what I do and take life as it comes to me. I am thankful for the many people that guide me and make me strive for betterment of both my character and my skills.
