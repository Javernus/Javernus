- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Javernus, formally known as Jace or Jake. 
- ðŸ‘€ My interests are broad and spread out over many areas, like programming, mathematics, playing piano, gaming, philosophy and reading! I also collect whiskies!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything and everything I can, studying Computer Science at the University of Amsterdam, but also much through my work at Enreach. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @JaceBond on Telegram! The other socials know me not.
